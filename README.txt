This OCaml library is a very simple module for parsing S-expressions.

You can use it under the terms of the Zlib license with or without
restrictions.

This version of the lib is NOT able to parse strings between double quotes "
and end line comments starting with semicolon ;

If you need to parse strings (for spaces inclusion) and comments
you can use ocaml-sexpr instead:
